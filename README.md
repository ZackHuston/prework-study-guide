# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was learning, seeing just how much I could learn. I built this assignment to possibly help me in other assingments or just to be a reference. It solves problems like not knowing something or forgetting something and istead of searching for it on the web, I can reference back to this project. I learned many things the biggest being the building blocks for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
